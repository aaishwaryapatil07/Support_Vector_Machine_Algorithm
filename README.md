# Support_Vector_Machine_Algorithm

Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification challenges.Support Vector Machine is a frontier which best segregates the two classes (hyper-plane/ line)

Note: Suited for data which is linearly seperable. Data is in small quantity

This repository contains 1 dataset on which we have applied SVM algorithm for  best prediction results
